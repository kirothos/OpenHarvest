##OpenHarvest

OpenHarvest is an open-source right-click-to-harvest-crop mod, and that's about it.

It supports any crop that functions like vanilla crops, and isn't limited to crops that are fully grown at age 7, any age will work!

This mod doesn't even need to be installed on clients, it will work serverside-only.

This branch is for the latest version of the mod.

This Open Source project (see [License](https://github.com/sblectric/OpenHarvest/blob/master/license.md)) is a mod for [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/), a game by [Mojang AB](http://mojang.com/).
